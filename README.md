# Navbar-facebook

Decided to practice my skills reproducing the Facebook navbar :-)

Also putting into practice my Sass knowledge along with RSCSS study.

Trying Normalize.css for the first time to see how it develops.

I'm developing through Chrome, Firefox and Opera to see the cross-browser compatibility.
